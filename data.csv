Suggestion for IAM service - Role inheritance,isiah_rippin@dicki.net,"Hi Aetheros Support,  We've been utilizing your IAM service for a few months now and are very happy with its features and performance.

For instance, we might have a 'Developer' role that needs access to specific cloud resources for development purposes. We then have a 'Senior Developer' role that needs all the permissions of a 'Developer' but with additional access, say, to production logs.  With a more granular inheritance model, we could assign only the necessary permissions to the 'Developer' role and then selectively inherit and add permissions for the 'Senior Developer' role. This would significantly improve security and management within our organization.  Could you consider implementing a more fine-grained role inheritance feature in the IAM service?

Suggestion: Enhance IAM Role Inheritance for Cloud Resources,isiah.von@koch.org,"Dear Aetheros Support Team,  We are currently leveraging your IAM service and Cloud Management platform to manage access to our cloud resources. We have been impressed with the overall functionality, but have identified a potential improvement area.  Currently, we haven't found a streamlined way to automatically inherit roles for cloud resources based on their parent resource. For example, if a user has a specific role assigned at the project level, it would be efficient if those permissions automatically applied to any resources created within that project.  Implementing a feature like this would significantly reduce manual configuration and potential for errors, simplifying our overall access management strategy.  We believe this enhancement would greatly benefit users like us who heavily rely on your services for granular and efficient cloud resource management.  Thank you for considering this suggestion.

For instance, instead of a generic 500 error, a more specific code indicating the nature of the issue (e.g., database connection error, authorization failure) would be highly beneficial. Additionally, including relevant details in the error message, such as the specific database query or configuration parameter that caused the issue, would further expedite the debugging process.  I believe implementing these improvements would significantly enhance the developer experience and streamline the integration process.  Thank you for considering my suggestion.
